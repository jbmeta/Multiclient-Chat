# Multiclient-Chat
A GUI chat application based on client-server architecture. This app was created to learn socket programming, multithreading and swing. Learn by doing is the best way.

To run the application, just download the client and server JARs, first start the server with a port number and then start client(s) with the IP address and port at which the server is listening to.
